RSA Simple Implementation using Python. 

## Theory
RSA (named after great mathematicians Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) is a public-key or asymmetric key crypto system which is widely used for secure data transmission all over the world. 

In asymmetric key encryption, Two unique or distinct keys are used. One for encryption and one for decryption process. One of the key is published publicly so, anyone else can send private messages by encrypting the message using that key to the owner of the key which is known as public key and the key used for decrypting the message by the owner is known as private key. The message encrypted using the public key can be only decrypted using the private key.
